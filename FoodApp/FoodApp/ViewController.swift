        count = 1
        topLabel.text = "My #1 favorite food is..."
        imageView.image = UIImage(named: "1.jpg")
        foodLabel.text = "Pasta!"
    }
    
    
    // Put an IBAction function header in here that detects when the button is pressed
    // IBAction function will get rid of current image, show next image in sequence
    // This can be accomplished by having a count variable and then naming each image 1, 2, 3, etc and just displaying image("count")
    // Shouldn't be too bad. A bit hacky, but not too bad
    // Also have to put my #1, #2 favorite food which can be accomplished by, again, using a count variable
    // When it hits the last food, set count back to 1
    // Have to change the label name of the food too, so perhaps create some sort of mapping data structure that maps food num to food title. That should work.
